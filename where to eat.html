  <h1>Our places to eat in</h1>
    <h2>Grub</h2>
    <h3>Kind of off campus but still on Old Aberdeen grounds (beside Old Aberdeen Bookshop), this cute little restaurant has amazing price values for paninis, wraps and salads.
      You can chill and have a good off time from studying.</h3>
    <h2>Kilau café</h2>
    <h3>little coffee shop on the high street (the best coffee in Aberdeen to be honest), quite pricy but totally worth it, for the quality of both food and coffee.
    It’s usually very packed but it’s a great place for laughs with friends or just chill and study.</h3>
    <h2>Foodstory</h2>
    <h3>zero waste café, amazing quality of food, this planet-friendly café’s idea consists of bringing you own cutlery,
    boxes, etc and wash them after you’re done with your meal.</h3>
    <h2>Starbucks coffee</h2>
    <h3>The only Starbucks we really enjoy, thanks to its pretty location (beside Crombie halls) and chill atmosphere.
      It can be very crowded but still amazingly quiet. </h3>
    <h2>Shelter coffee</h2>
    <h3>New little café in front of the King’s museum, beautiful view from their terrace and super friendly stuff.
    Amazing cakes, kind of pricy but we think it might be because of they are just starting off.</h3>
    <h2>Student Hub/Union</h2>
    <h3>Union Brew is the relatively new Students union café, lots of events going on almost every day, friendly stuff. Food court has everything you need: from Mexican to Asian or Vegan.
      Pocket friendly and super yummy. </h3>
